📚 About the Course
Algorithms and Data Structures II is a fundamental continuation for any Computer Science student. It deepens the concepts of data structures and algorithms, essential for developing efficient and scalable solutions.

Some of the topics covered (but not limited to):

Advanced Data Structures: Trees (binary, AVL, B-trees), Graphs, Hash Tables 🌳🔗

Week 1 Focus: This week, we're diving into struct in C, a powerful way to organize related data!

Optimized Sorting and Searching Algorithms: Mergesort, Quicksort, Heapsort, Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS) ⚙️🔍

Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms 💡💰

Algorithm Complexity Analysis: Big O (O), Omega (Ω), Theta (Θ) Notation 📈

🛠 Technologies Used
Language: C

Editor: Visual Studio Code

Version Control: Git + GitHub

😎 Who am I?
My name is Zeze or Zezas (José Nelson), a Computer Science student.
A programming enthusiast, strong coffee ☕, and well-indented code.
This repository helps me practice and also assists colleagues with their questions!
